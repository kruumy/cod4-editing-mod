## Support

| Name | Status |
| --- | --- |
| COD4 1.7 | No |
| [IW3xo](https://github.com/xoxor4d/iw3xo-dev) | Yes |
| [COD4x](https://cod4x.me/) | No |

**[Auto IW3xo Installer](https://github.com/kruumy/iw3xo-one-click-installer)**

*The mod on stock Cod4 and Cod4x exceeds the 128 weapons asset limit and 1000 xmodel limit. Probably could work if you delete some of the custom weapons but just use iw3xo anyway it's better.*

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from **releases**. -->
2. Extract and put the folder in the cod4 mod directory.
3. Done!

* Note: **Ads + Knifing** Opens The In-Game Menu.
* Also delete the **iw_zzz_menu_music.iwd** to get rid of background photo and music.
* Sometimes giving a weapon or spawning while the demo is recording will crash the demo at that time. Make sure to stop record and rerecord between.

## Todo

* Make drop weapons mod work on pezbots
* Fix leg bug on death anims.
* Replace heli model with mw3 heli model.
* Add more custom models to the change model menu.
* Fix some weird weapon index bug.
* Fix SP maps not working.
* Fix postions on the menu.
* Have congruent name for all dvars like mvm_
* change timings on all weapons to be like promod.
* Try to make it work with stock cod4 and cod4x
* Replace playmodels with mwr playermodels
* ~~Add EB.~~
* Add button to increase player damage to make one shot.
* Add rpg bullets.
* Add hud popups when enabling things in the menu.
* Make trailer and make banner.
* Make the toggles actually toggle and not just enable
* Clean the mod, too bloated
